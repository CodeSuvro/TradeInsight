## 🚀 Overview  
This is a **demo project** built during a hackathon, aimed at exploring how **AI and machine learning** can be applied to trading data for predictive insights.  

The model currently works on **historical datasets**, detecting patterns and generating predictions on potential market movements.  
While still in development, this project reflects a blend of **curiosity, persistence, and a lot of coffee**.  


## ✨ Features  

- ✅ Processes historical trading data  
- ✅ Predicts market movements based on patterns  
- ✅ Simple dashboard for visualization  
- ✅ Clean UI (after a long battle with the navbar 😅)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Python 3.10+**  
- **scikit-learn** (ML models)  
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data processing)  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **Flask / Streamlit** (dashboard prototype)  


## 🔮 Roadmap  

- [ ] Connect to live APIs for real-time trading data  
- [ ] Expand datasets for improved accuracy  
- [ ] Enhance model performance  
- [ ] Deploy interactive version online  


## 📚 Learning Journey  

This project taught me more than just machine learning:  
- How frustrating a navbar can be 😅  
- How much coffee it takes to power all-night coding sprints  
- And most importantly, how **AI can turn trading chaos into clarity**  


## 💡 Why This Project?  

Trading is unpredictable—but data always leaves clues.  
This demo is my attempt to uncover those patterns, and to prove that curiosity + persistence can lead to something meaningful.
